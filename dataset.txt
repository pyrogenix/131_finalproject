I'm looking at 2 potential datasets for this project so far.

First,
https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new

This dataset contains over 6000 YouTube videos that were featured on the trending tab
at some point and includes information on the video, the channel that posted it, it's category,
it's tags, and the number of view, likes, and dislikes. I plan on seeing how different things
affect the like to dislike ratio as well as the amount of views. Do videos in one category 
get a higher ratio than videos in another? What about with times they were posted? Does the number of views versus l/d ratio show a trend? Does the season affect how often videos
are disliked? are all questions I could potentially answer with this dataset.

Second,
https://www.kaggle.com/mysarahmadbhat/online-chess-games

This dataset contains "Data for 20,000+ chess games played on Lichess, including moves, victor, rating, opening details and more." With this data, I could, for example, analyze if the number
of turns affects one color's chance of winning, whether the number of turns affected the status
(resign or mate), etc.
